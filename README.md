# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Application

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying and managing cloud infrastructure across multiple environments. The solution implements CI/CD best practices with automated workflows for development and production environments.

## Environment Management

The repository supports isolated deployment environments through Terraform workspaces:

| Environment    | Workspace  | Trigger Condition              |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Production     | `prod`     | Merges to `main` branch        |
| Development    | `dev`      | All other branches and PRs     |

This separation enables safe testing of infrastructure changes before promoting to production.

**Relevant Implementation**:  
See [`/.github/workflows/deployment.yaml`](/.github/workflows/deployment.yaml) (lines 75-86)
